What is socket programming?

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

Pythonâ€™s socket module provides an interface to the Berkeley sockets API.

The primary socket API functions and methods in this module are:

socket()
bind()
listen()
accept()
connect()
connect_ex()
send()
recv()
close()

Python provides a convenient and consistent API that maps directly to these system calls, their C counterparts.
